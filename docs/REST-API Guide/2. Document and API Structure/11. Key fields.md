title: Key Fields
---
Each payload contains a nested sub-group identified by the primary key field name, that provides all the key fields of a document. As a minimum, this sub-group always contains the primary key field and an 'external key' field.

## External Key
External key fields exist on all documents and is designed to be used to store the external system's unique identifier for a record. The external key field can then be used in future look-ups as opposed to having to know the Xytech primary key field value.

Example below shows a section of the Job's (jm_job) key fields in the sub-group job_no:
```JSON
{
    "jm_job": [
        {
            "job_no": {
                "job_no": 342,
                "external_key": "154110"
            },
            "division_no": {
                "division_no": 2,
                "division_desc": "Burbank ",
                "division_code": "BRB",
                "external_key": null
            },
            "cust_id": {
                "list_id": "409",
                "other_cust_id": null,
                "cust_reference": null,
                "external_key": null,
                "cust_id": "409"
            },
            "other_cust_id": null,
            "customer_name": "Tupper Lake Films",
            ...
```

 Some documents may have additional key fields which will all be contained within the same sub-group, such as Media Assets (known by the document name lib_master) 
## Generating the primary key 
When creating records using the POST method, to generate the primary key set the value to -1.  
When creating multiple sub-table records in a single that need it's own next value generated, advance the value by one for each separate sub-table key field needed, E.g -1, -2, -3 etcâ€¦

Be aware some fields are mandatory, and are defined in the OpenAPI definition.

The id of the created record is returned in the response payload.
