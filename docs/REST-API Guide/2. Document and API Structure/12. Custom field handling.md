title: Custom Field Handling
---
Any custom fields you have defined through document customization are automatically included in REST API definition. There is specific naming convention that is a combination of the Custom Code you created via document customisation plus the internal field name concatenated with an underscore. i.e. {customization code}\_{field name}
