This collection contains many example calls, including basic payload version to get you started.

## Using cURL as a test client
cURL is a lightweight command line API client used for testing and troubleshooting.

Example curl to fetch job details (replace authorization string, baseURL and database name with your values)
```http
curl --location 'https://baseURL/api/v2/database/DEMO/JmJob/job_no=342' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic eHl0ZWNoOnh5dGjaHB3' \
```
