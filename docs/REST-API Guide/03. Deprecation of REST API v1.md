title: Deprecation of REST API v1 and migration to v2
---

REST API v1 was the first Xytech REST API product. It had limitations that required breaking changes to improve so v2 was made available from Xytech v9.4 with improved functionality.

REST API v1 is no longer supported in version 11.0 and beyond.  

REST API v1 will no longer work from v11.1  

All new integrations should use API v2 and existing integrations should port to v2.  

To use v2 API, change the base URL version number from ../v1/.. to ../v2/..

## Changes in v2 API 

### Payload structure changes
<p align="justify">The payload structure has been enhanced to be more robust and scalable.
The primary data object name is now always added as the root element of the payload with an array containing the details.Â 
v2 handles sub tables more gracefully and respects the hierarchy of the tables. With v1, the sub tables were often added to the bottom of the payload at the root level, which made it difficult to determine the relationship between tables and their sub items. With v2, the table names are included in the payload and the sub tables are added as children to maintain the relationships.</p>

*Example showing the root element for JmJob*

| API v1 JSON structure                           | API v2 JSON structure                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

All sub-tables are offset from the root object.
See the OpenAPI documentation for details of the JSON structure for each endpoint.

In addition, v2 has many enhancements as detailed in this document.


## Migrating to API v2 

Change your URL to the v2  path. i.e. change
Example base URL
API v1
http://domain/api/v1/database/XYT_MAIN_V
API v2
http://domain/api/v2/database/XYT_MAIN_V
