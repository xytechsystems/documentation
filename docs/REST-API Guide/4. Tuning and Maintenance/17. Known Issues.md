## POST & GET payload differences
There are differences in the payload structure between POST & GET calls when filtering by sub-table.
When using GET to fetch a payload filtered by a sub-table, the payload is missing the sub-table wrapper. The Swagger definition reports the correct payload structure that includes the sub-table wrapper, but that is not what works today.
A fix would mean a breaking change, so we shall not be correcting this until API v3.

Example of how Swagger defines the GET response payload for a sub-table of /XmTransmissionOrder endpoint, which includes the wrapper in this case mo_service_row.
```json
{
  "mo_service_row": [
    {
      "service_header": "string",
      "service_desc": "string",
      "service_row_no": {
        "service_row_no": 0,
        "external_key": "string"
      },
      "dsp_seq": 0,
      ...
```

Below is how the the enpoint actually responds that excludes the wrapper.
```json
[
    {
      "service_header": "Y",
      "service_desc": "AUTO ROUTE",
      "service_row_no": {
        "service_row_no": 7428,
        "external_key": null
      },
      "dsp_seq": 1,
      ...
```

## Sub-table record creation respond with invalid IDs
When using a POST call that includes creating sub-table records, some endpoints respond with invalid sub-table record IDs that are negative values. This will be resolved in v11.1
