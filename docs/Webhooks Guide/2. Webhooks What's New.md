title: Webhooks What's New

## <font color="#c00000">v11.0</font>
## Response payload parsing and storing of values
Webhooks now includes the ability to store value(s) received in the response body into a field from the triggered document.

This allows Xytech to store the ID generated by an external system as a result of a web hook POST that creates the record. See [Export Adaptor](4.%20Export%20Adaptor.md)

## URL Parameters now use table names (not DOC prefix)
When configuring an Export Adaptor to use URL parameters, to include a filed in the URL the fireld name is now prefixed by table name (as opposed to DOC.).

## GET is added as an Export Adaptor method
Given the introduction of the response parsing feature, it now makes sense to add the GET method as an option. 

## Export Adaptor square brackets allowed
Webhooks, Event Trigger - Export Adaptor payload template will now accept JSON payloads that start with square brackets. The JSON validator will no longer object.
