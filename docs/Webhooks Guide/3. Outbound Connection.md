| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Enter a label for the connection, such as the name and version of the external system or interface. |
| **External Key** | Optionally enter a label to identify the external system, as with any Xytech document. |
| **Authentication Method** | 
Select the method used to log in to the external system:

**Base URL 1**

**Base URL 2**

 | 

Enter the base URL(s) of the external system. 

**Base URL 1** is required.

**Base URL 2** is optional. 

See note below on Base URL fail over

 |
| 

**Username**

 | Enter the login account used to authenticate to the external system. |
| 

**Password**

 | Enter the password used to authenticate to the external system. |

**Base URL Fail-over**

Where you have specified a secondary URL, the fail-over logic will be enabled.

If Base URL 1 does not respond after the retry count, set in the Export Adaptor, the system will then fail-over to Base URL 2.

Assuming Base URL 2 is successful, all following triggers will first be sent to Base URL 2.

If Base URL 2 fails to respond, then the system will fail-over back to Base URL 1. 

If both Base URLs are unavailable, the system will give up after the fail-over Base URL fails to respond. (it will not continue to flip-flop between Base URLs)
