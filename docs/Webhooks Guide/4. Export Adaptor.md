title: Export Adaptor
---

Export Adaptors define the endpoint(s) for an Outbound Connection. An Export Adaptor is assigned to a specific Event Trigger so that the triggered payload knows where to be sent.

| **Endpoint**        | Add the endpoint of the API and include the initial backslash. E.g. /orders. The endpoint can include URL Parameters, as described in _[URL Parameters](https://helpcenter.xytechsystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/20338332222107-Webhooks-User-Guide#url_parameters)_ below If there is no endpoint and the payload can be sent to the base URL, simply add a forward slash ‘/’ into the endpoint field. |
| **Retry Count**     | If there is no response from the endpoint, the retry count defines the number of times the system will attempt to send the payload before trying the other Outbound Connection URL (if one has been defined).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Retry Delay**     | The duration in seconds between retries when an outbound message does not receive a response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Time Out**        | The duration in seconds to wait for a response from the endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Disable Logging** | Select (check) to stop capturing activity into the Export Adapter Log. The default setting is deselected (cleared).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Headers**         | Provides the ability for the webhook to send custom headers and whether they are to be treated as Content Headers (default = false)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**URL Parameters  =={needs updating}==
**URL Parameters can be added to endpoints and include a combination of static text and dynamically populated values from the triggered document. Use the same field naming convention as defining the payload template for an Event Trigger.  
_Examples:_

-   -   {base URL}/{endpoint}/external\_key=\[DOC.external\_key\]
        
    -   {base URL}/{endpoint} /job\_no=\[DOC.job\_no\]/jm\_episode
