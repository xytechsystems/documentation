## Export Adaptor custom headers override default
You are now able to add a custom header of 'Content-Type' to an Export Adaptor that will override the default generated Content-Type header. Note: you must flag the custom header as a Content Header.

## Export Adaptor Logs improved capture of failures
Webhooks Export Adaptor logging has been enhanced so that errors are logged when the error occurs prior to being able to execute the API call. This gives greater logging visibility to users especially when in the past no log entry would be created and the user would have no awareness.

## Encode illegal characters in outbound payload
WebhooksÂ Export Adaptor Template now includes encoding of whitespace characters.

## Response payload parsing and storing of values
Webhooks now includes the ability to store value(s) received in the response body into a field from the triggered document.

This allows Xytech to store the ID generated by an external system as a result of a web hook POST that creates the record. See [Export Adaptor](Export%20Adaptor.md)

## URL Parameters now use table names (not DOC prefix)
When configuring an Export Adaptor to use URL parameters, to include a filed in the URL the field name is now prefixed by table name (as opposed to DOC) which makes it clearer to understand it's source.

## GET is added as an Export Adaptor method
Given the introduction of the response parsing feature, it now makes sense to add the GET method as an option. 

## Export Adaptor square brackets allowed
Webhooks, Event Trigger - Export Adaptor payload template will now accept JSON payloads that start with square brackets. The JSON validator will no longer object.
