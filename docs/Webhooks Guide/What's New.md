## Ability to disable Export Adaptors or Outbound Connections
The webhooks feature now has the ability to deactivate Export Adaptors or Outbound Connections. This can be very useful especially when restoring a backup onto a test or development instance to prevent accidental outbound integrations from happening to production external services.

## ISO Datetime formats
Export Adaptors now includes an optional flag to send all dates in ISO standard format.

## Ability to include child-table field values
https://dev.azure.com/xytsystems/Xytech%20Platform/_workitems/edit/24750
Export adaptor payloads can include an array of values from child tables.
The syntax requires the array fields to be nested under child table tags using specific syntax as shown in the example below. 

```
#[<child table name>]
	<fields>
#[/<child table name>]
```

The JSON syntax must be manually managed around these table tags.
You can drag and drop fields from the child table onto the template text area where the prefix syntax of the table name will be automatically applied.

An example Export Adaptor payload template for a Media Order Event Trigger that includes a list of Services and a list of Operations.
```json
{
  "document": "MoMediaOrder",
  "id": "[jm_work_order.wo_no_seq]",
  "idField": "wo_no_seq",
  "details": [
		{
	       "services": [
			    #[mo_service_row]
		        {
		          "description": "[mo_service_row.service_desc]",
		          "service_row_no": "[mo_service_row.service_row_no]"
		        }
			    #[/mo_service_row]
		        ],
			"operations": [
		    	#[mo_operation]
			     {
			           "service_row_no": "",
			           "description": "[mo_operation.trx_resource_code]",
			           "op_no": "[mo_operation.operation_no]"
				 }
				#[/mo_operation]
				 ]
		}
	],
	"type": "UPDATE"
}
```
Note: Warning, this will make the template non-JSON standard. The template syntax will be validated as Xytech compliant on save.

Example payload generated:
```json
{
  "document": "MoMediaOrder",
  "id": "109483-1",
  "idField": "wo_no_seq",
  "details": [
    {
       "services": [
               {
          "description": "Color Program/Review - Per Hr",
          "service_row_no": "50094"
        },
              {
          "description": "Color Program/Review - Per Hr",
          "service_row_no": "50095"
        },
              {
          "description": "142 Digital Receipt",
          "service_row_no": "229496"
        }
      
        ],
      "operations": [
                {
          "service_row_no": "",
          "description": "",
          "op_no": "71032"
        },
                {
          "service_row_no": "",
          "description": "",
          "op_no": "71033"
        }
        
      ]
    }

  ],
  "type": "UPDATE"
}

```

Please note that the tables cannot be nested within each other, only one level of sub-tables is supported. No restrictions on which table is used to setup the trigger conditions as the code is document based. In other words, if your document is Media Order, you could use any sub table in the trigger conditions and all the available sub tables could be used in the template.

## Export Adaptor custom headers override default
You are now able to add a custom header of 'Content-Type' to an Export Adaptor that will override the default generated Content-Type header. Note: you must flag the custom header as a Content Header.

## Export Adaptor Logs improved capture of failures
Webhooks Export Adaptor logging has been enhanced so that errors are logged when the error occurs prior to being able to execute the API call. This gives greater logging visibility to users especially when in the past no log entry would be created and the user would have no awareness.

## Encode illegal characters in outbound payload
Webhooks Export Adaptor Template now includes encoding of whitespace characters.


## <font color="#c00000">v11.0</font>
## Response payload parsing and storing of values
Webhooks now includes the ability to store value(s) received in the response body into a field from the triggered document.

This allows Xytech to store the ID generated by an external system as a result of a web hook POST that creates the record. See [Export Adaptor](Export%20Adaptor.md)

## URL Parameters now use table names (not DOC prefix)
When configuring an Export Adaptor to use URL parameters, to include a filed in the URL the field name is now prefixed by table name (as opposed to DOC) which makes it clearer to understand it's source.

## GET is added as an Export Adaptor method
Given the introduction of the response parsing feature, it now makes sense to add the GET method as an option. 

## Export Adaptor square brackets allowed
Webhooks, Event Trigger - Export Adaptor payload template will now accept JSON payloads that start with square brackets. The JSON validator will no longer object.
## <font color="#c00000">v10.6</font>

## Ability to define custom headers for Export Adaptors
## Enhanced URL fail-over logic for Outbound Connections

## <font color="#c00000">v10.4</font>
## Webhooks Feature Introduced in v10.4
