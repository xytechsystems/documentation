title: Export Adaptor Logs

When Export Adaptors are enabled for logging, all external communications will be logged into the Export Adaptor Log to assist with auditing and troubleshooting. (By default, logging is enabled for all adaptors.) From the navigation menu, click **System** and click **Export Adaptor Logs** to view the log entries.

Click the ID in the **Export Adaptor Log No** column to view the details of a log entry, including all relevant values such as date times and request/response payloads.

The Action Menu in individual documents also displays the Export Adaptor Logs for that specific item. For example, when viewing a Work Order, the Action filters the log entries to that specific Work Order only.

#### **Auto Log Clean-Up**

To prevent the log tables from growing exponentially due to large payload values, a periodic clean-up process removes the request and response payloads from "old" log items. The system retains the log entry that provides information that the payload was sent but removes the payloads. The default setting for this process is to clean up log items older than 60 days. This setting can be manually overwritten if required via the Application Server configuration settings.
