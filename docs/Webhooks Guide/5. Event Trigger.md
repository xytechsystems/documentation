title: Event Trigger
---


The Webhooks functionality builds on the existing Event Trigger features of the Media Operations Platform, providing a notification template option where you can assign an Export Adaptor and the payload template.

The Event Trigger defines the criteria that determine when a payload is sent, the method and content of the payload, and the Export Adapter to which it is sent.

-   The Event Triggers and Conditions tabs determine the criteria of when to send payloads.
-   The Notifications tab determines the method used to send the payload.
-   The Notification Template tab determines the destination of the trigger content.

Refer to the _**Online Help**_ for more information about Event Triggers and how to configure them.

## Conditions
Defines the field conditions that initiate a trigger, such as when a specific field is set or modified.

## Notifications
Establishes the notification type – select ‘Email/Alert’ for webhooks.

## Notification Template
Defines the action to take for the trigger.

## Export Adaptor Trigger Parameters

Select the Export Adaptor to use, as configured in the [Export Adaptor](4.%20Export%20Adaptor.md) section.

### Generate Default Template

Click to generate a standard payload template for the selected Document, Event Type, and Export Adaptor.

If any of the Document, Event Type, or Export Adaptor Type definitions change, you should re-generate the default template which will overwrite the previous template. If manual changes have been made to the template, you can update manually or note the additions prior to regenerating the template and reapply the changes.

### Export Adaptor Template

-   Displays the payload template used to generate the payload.
-   Either in JSON or XML format. (The format of the template should match the format specified in the Export Adapter that will use the template.)
-   Caution needs to be taken to ensure correct syntax is used and avoid adding carriage returns that add invisible or illegal characters.
-   It’s recommended to construct the template in a syntax-checking text editor outside of the Xytech UI first before pasting it back into the UI to avoid errors.
-   If there are errors, this will be visible in the export adaptor log during trigger sending and will fail to send.
-   Users can add document fields to the payload using the syntax \[DOC.fieldName\]  
    Optionally, users can drag and drop a field from the Template Fields list on the left into the payload template field. Note that you can only use fields from the triggered document and not related tables.

**_Prefix File Naming Conventions_**

-   ==The generic ‘DOC’ prefix before the field name is an abbreviation/placeholder for the triggered document. E.g. DOC.wo\_no\_seq==
-   You can also use the table name as the prefix to the field name.  
    E.g. jm\_work\_order.wo\_no\_seq


## Parsing and storing of response payload values
Response payload parsing and storing of values. [16326](https://dev.azure.com/xytsystems/Xytech%20Platform/_workitems/edit/16326)

Web hooks includes the ability to store a value(s) received in the response body back into a field from the triggered document.

This allows Xytech to store the ID generated by an external system as a result of a web hook POST that creates the record.

Supports scalar and single values to be read and stored. Not arrays or JSON objects.
If you don’t specify a content type, the default will be plain text.
Mandatory for response to include content type header:
‘Content-Type’ of either 
•	application/json 
•	application/xml 
•	text/plain.
 Can only store values back into the originating document, not related documents.

### Configure Export Adaptor's response format
The Export adaptor now includes ‘Response Format’ parameter to define the expected response format.

Includes Notes and Blob base64 image values.

### Event Trigger Response Parsing Template
The Event Trigger includes a new field to define the Export Adaptor’s ‘Response Parsing Template’.
Here you will add the parse criteria in the format of ```<database field> = <parse field>```.

### Parse JSON 
Example
Response payload:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "desc": "This is sample description.",
        "id": "ABCEFJ23454"
    }
}
```

To retrieve the ‘id’ value a response template would contain:
[table.column] = data.id

If the originating document was Title and you wanted to store the value into ‘external_key’, then the full example would look like this:
[lib_title.external_key] = data.id

You can store more than one value from the response payload: 
e.g.:
[table.field1] = data.id
[table.field2] = data.desc

### Parse XML 
To parse an XML response, use  XPATH syntax.
W3Schools XPath tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp

Simple parse:
[lib_title.external_key] = response/desc

An attribute of an element:
[lib_title.external_key] = catalog/book/@id		

Return all values under /response
[lib_title.title_desc_2] = response


[lib_title. title_desc_2] = catalog/book[@id='bk102']/title

Example XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<catalog>
     <book id="bk101">
        <author>Gambardella, Matthew</author>
        <title>XML Developer's Guide</title>
        <genre>Computer</genre>
        <price>44.95</price>
        <publish_date>2000-10-01</publish_date>
        <description>An in-depth look at creating applications 
        with XML.</description>
     </book>
     <book id="bk102">
        <author>Ralls, Kim</author>
        <title>Midnight Rain</title>
        <genre>Fantasy</genre>
        <price>5.95</price>
        <publish_date>2000-12-16</publish_date>
        <description>A former architect battles corporate zombies, 
        an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen 
        of the world.</description>
     </book>
</catalog>
```
 
[lib_title.external_key] = catalog/book/@id		returns the first id
[lib_title.title_desc_2] = catalog/book[@id='bk102']/title	returns null
[lib_title.note_no_text] = catalog/book		returns all values from the first item only – expected both items.
