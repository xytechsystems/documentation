## 30981 REST API resolve inconsistency between single and multi-value responses when fetching standard multi-select drop-downs
<font color="#ff0000">Breaking change</font>
Resolves an issue of inconsistency with REST API responses for standard drop-down multi-select fields between single or multi-values (example being bid_preference.bid_actual_phase). Now responses will always be a complex object, that includes additional key fields, for both single value and multi-value responses.

This represents a breaking change for integrations that parse standard multi-select drop-downs.
