## Features
## 27014 REST API JmWorkOrder Save Argument for WO transaction date change option
REST API has been enhanced so that Order transaction times will be updated when changing Work Order times by a single PATCH call. This is enabled by including a header 'Save Argument' called TrxTimeOptionMove or TrxTimeOptionAdjust. 

Applies to XmTransmissionOrder and MoMediaOrder

See the REST API user guide for details.

## LibTitleHierachyFacade

Usage
Manages parent/child title relationships
Create new child title
Update child title relationship

PUT - where an existing child title exists, will update the parent relationship but not update the child title values. Need to use separate endpoint for that. Known limitation.



## 30981 REST API resolve inconsistency between single and multi-value responses when fetching standard multi-select drop-downs
<font color="#ff0000">Breaking change</font>
Resolves an issue of inconsistency with REST API responses for standard drop-down multi-select fields between single or multi-values (example being bid_preference.bid_actual_phase). Now responses will always be a complex object, that includes additional key fields, for both single value and multi-value responses.

This represents a breaking change for integrations that parse standard multi-select drop-downs.
