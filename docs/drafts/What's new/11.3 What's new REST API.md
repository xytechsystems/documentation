## OpenID Authentication for REST API

- Client Credentials
- SPA / browser sign-in

#### Known auth providers
Azure
Okta
- Our API accepts Okta‑issued tokens with the standard “client credentials” method
Google
- **Client‑credentials:** Not available (Google doesn’t issue that grant).

## Child templates of Work Order Templates are now loaded.
When creating or updating an order you can load a work order template along with any child templates associated. This has been accomplished by adding an additional optional parameter to the existing Save Argument called 'LoadChildTemplates'

e.g. header: 
```
SaveArgument: {"LoadTemplate":"1012","LoadChildTemplates":"Y"}
```

## Ability to enable custom drop-down fields to return additional attributes
Users can now enable **custom dropdown fields** (through a new document customisation flag) so that when called by the REST API will return the additional attributes stored with the dropdown record such as external_key.

Example of a custom drop-down field when 'Additional API details' is <u>not</u> enabled:
