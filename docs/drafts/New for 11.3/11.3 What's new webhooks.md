## Ability to disable Export Adaptors or Outbound Connections
26565 
The webhooks feature now has the ability to deactivate Export Adaptors or Outbound Connections. This can be very useful especially when restoring a backup onto a test or development instance to prevent accidental outbound integrations from happening to production external services.


## ISO Datetime formats
27017
Export Adaptors (Web hooks) now includes an optional flag to send all dates in ISO standard format.

## Ability to include child-table field values
https://dev.azure.com/xytsystems/Xytech%20Platform/_workitems/edit/24750

Export adaptor payloads can include an array of values from child tables.
The syntax requires the array fields to be between table tags using specific syntax as shown in the example below. 

```
#[<child table name>]
	<fields>
#[/<child table name>]
```

The JSON syntax must be manually managed around these table tags.
The syntax for the table name is automatically applied by dragging the table names into the template text area.

```json
{
  "document": "MoMediaOrder",
  "id": "[jm_work_order.wo_no_seq]",
  "idField": "wo_no_seq",
  "details": [
		{
	       "services": [
			    #[mo_service_row]
		        {
		          "description": "[mo_service_row.service_desc]",
		          "service_row_no": "[mo_service_row.service_row_no]"
		        }
			    #[/mo_service_row]
		        ],
			"operations": [
		    	#[mo_operation]
			     {
			           "service_row_no": "",
			           "description": "[mo_operation.trx_resource_code]",
			           "op_no": "[mo_operation.operation_no]"
				 }
				#[/mo_operation]
				 ]
		}
	],
	"type": "UPDATE"
}
```
Note: Warning, this will make the template non-JSON standard, so you will be unable to edit withing a JSON editor.

Example payload generated:
```json
{
  "document": "MoMediaOrder",
  "id": "109483-1",
  "idField": "wo_no_seq",
  "details": [
    {
       "services": [
               {
          "description": "Color Program/Review - Per Hr",
          "service_row_no": "50094"
        },

        ],
      "operations": [
                {
          "service_row_no": "",
          "description": "",
          "op_no": "71032"
        },
                {
          "service_row_no": "",
          "description": "",
          "op_no": "71033"
        }
        
      ]
    }

  ],
  "type": "UPDATE"
}

```

Please note that the tables cannot be nested within each other, only one level of sub-tables are supported. No restrictions on which table is used to setup the trigger conditions as the code is document based. In other words, if your document is Media Order, you could use any sub tables in the trigger conditions and all the available sub tables could be used in the template.
